    <string name="hannibal_detail">" Adapted from the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and brought to the silver screen, this 1991 psychological thriller is directed by Jonathan Demme. In this gripping adaptation of Thomas J. Harris's novel, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), an FBI trainee, delves into the depths of the twisted mind of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist turned cannibalistic serial killer, by entering a high-security asylum. Starling needs clues to catch a serial killer, but unfortunately, her Faustian relationship with Lecter leads to his escape, allowing two separate serial killers to roam freely in the darkness. Nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1992, the film secured golden statuettes for its director and lead actors, as well as winning Best Film and Best Adapted Screenplay. Jodie Foster, who played the lead role, joined the ranks of actors who won two Oscars before turning 30. Anthony Hopkins won the Best Actor Oscar for his 16-minute performance in this film, marking the shortest screen time for an actor in a film. It is the only horror film to win the Best Film Oscar. A sequel titled \"Hannibal,\" directed by Ridley Scott, was released in 2001."</string>
    <string name="seven_detail">"A group of villagers, who witness the courage and selflessness of the master samurai Kambei, implore him to protect their villages that are constantly raided by bandits. Despite having no personal gain in mind, Kambei agrees and first takes on Katsushiro, a young samurai who becomes his disciple, and later Kikuchiyo, who initially appears to be a warrior but is revealed to be a farmer's son with a passion for combat. As Kambei adds four more samurai to his team and embarks on defending the village, he is warmly welcomed by the villagers and gains their affection. He begins to teach them how to defend themselves. Meanwhile, the bandits lurk at the village's borders, waiting for the right moment to launch new attacks.  Considered the pinnacle of Akira Kurosawa's career, Seven Samurai, despite its three-hour-plus duration, contains numerous details in its war and \"action\" scenes that would engage even the least attentive viewer, especially given the scarcity of quality examples from that era. It is a masterpiece that maintains the integrity of its storytelling and cinematic quality, never compromising on either aspect.     "</string>
